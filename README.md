1. SpecificationThe third programming project involves writing a program to calculate the terms of the following sequence ofnumbers: 0 1 3 8 21 55 144 377 … where each term is three times the previous term minus the second previousterm. The 0th term of the sequence is 0 and the 1st term of the sequence is 1.The example below shows how to calculate the next sequence term:Current sequence: 0 1 Calculate next term: 3 * 1 – 0 = 3Current sequence: 0 1 3 Calculate next term: 3 * 3 – 1 = 8Current sequence: 0 1 3 8 Calculate next term: 3 * 8 – 3 = 21Current sequence: 0 1 3 8 21 Calculate next term: 3 * 21 – 8 = 55… etc.The interface to the program should be a Swing based GUI that looks similar to the following:The pair of radio buttons allows the user to choose whether an iterative or recursive method is used to computethe term of the sequence (the Iterative radio button should be initially selected). When the user enters a valuefor n and then clicks the Compute button, the nth term of the sequence (counting from zero) should be displayedin the Result field. The Efficiency field should contain the number of calls to the recursive method when therecursive option is chosen and the number of iterations of the loop when the iterative option is selected. Theprogram will check the validity of the user input value which should be a positive integer. A message will beshown in a JOptionPane for illegal entered values.When the window is closed, the efficiency values should be computed with values of n from 0 to 15 and written toa text file outData.txt. Each line of the file should contain the value of n, the efficiency of the iterative method forthat value of n and the efficiency of the recursive method. The values should be separated by commas so the filecan be opened with Excel and used to graph the value of the efficiencies for both the iterative and recursiveoptions along the y axis and with the value of n along the x-axis. The graph should be included in the solutiondescription document that accompanies this project and should also contain a brief explanation of the observedresults.The program should consist of two classes: P3GUI and Sequence.21. Class P3GUI should define the Swing based GUI and should be hand-coded and not generated by a GUIgenerator. In addition to the main method and a constructor to build the GUI, an event handler will be needed tohandle the Compute button click and another handler will be needed to produce the file described above whenthe window is closed. The latter handler should be an object of an inner class that extends the WindowAdapterclass.2. Class Sequence should be a utility class meaning that all its methods must be class (static) methods and noobjects should be able to be generated for that class. It should contain three public methods:a. The first method computeIterative should accept a value of n and return the corresponding element inthe sequence using iteration.b. The second method computeRecursive should accept a value of n and return the corresponding elementin the sequence using recursion. This method will initialize the efficiency counter before calling the privaterecursive method that will actually perform the recursive computation.c. The third method getEfficiency will return the efficiency counter left behind by the previous call to eitherof the above two methods.Your program should compile without errors.The Google recommended Java style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) should be used toformat and document your code. Specifically, the following style guide attributes should be addressed: Header comments include filename, author, date and brief purpose of the program. In-line comments used to describe major functionality of the code. Meaningful variable names and prompts applied. Class names are written in UpperCamelCase. Variable names are written in lowerCamelCase. Constant names are in written in All Capitals. Braces use K&amp;R style.In addition the following design constraints should be followed: Declare all instance variables private Avoid the duplication of codeTest cases should be supplied in the form of a table with columns indicating what aspect is tested, the inputvalues, expected output, actual output and if the test case passed or failed. This table should contain 5 columnswith appropriate labels and a row for each test case. Note that the actual output should be the actual results youreceive when running your program and applying the input for the test record. Be sure to select enough differentkinds of employees and situations to completely test the program.2. Submission RequirementsSubmit the following to the Project 3 assignment area no later than the due date listed in your LEO classroom.1. Source files P3GUI.java, Sequence.java and the program generated output file outData.txt. The source codeshould use Java code conventions and appropriate code layout (white space management and indents) andcomments. All submitted files may be included in a .zip file.32.
